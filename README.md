# Displacement field

Scripts to investigate displacement field: A 2D vector field that describes how magnetic field line footpoints in the two hemispheres are displaced relative to predictions from a main magnetic field model. 

The code is tested for the specific application of making figures for the corresponding paper. If you want to use it for anything else, it is a good idea to get in touch. 

The code includes a Python script for spherical cap harmonic analysis. It's not super stable yet, and crashes for certain truncation levels. This should be easy to fix, and I would be happy to help if anyone wants to use this code.
